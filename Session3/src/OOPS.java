 	OOPS:
 	Use Case : Make My Trip
 	
 	
 	Object Oriented Programming Structure
 	> Object
 	> Class
 	
 	Object is a Multi Value Container. It is meant to hold data :)
 		Data may be homo or hetro
 		Object will store the data as key/value pair -> attribute/data :)
 	
 	Class is a textual representation how our object will look like in memory
 	i.e. we code the object as class :)
 	
 	Principle of OOPS
 	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 	1. Think about Object
 		anything in our problem statement which may have lot of data associated to it
 		Write data associated with it which we call as attributes
 	2. Create the Class for that Object
 	3. From the class create a Real Object in Memory :)		
 
 	Problem Statement: Client needs a travel web app from us as developers
 	 				   we need to think of a solution:
 	 				   we got below options:
 	 				   Flight Booking, Train Booking, Cab Booking, Bus Booking.....
 	 				   
 	 				   FlightBooking -> is an Object
 	 				    Attributes:
 	 				   	from, to, departureDate, travelers, travelClass
 	 				   	// Here we need to think as much as we can to gather data for FlightBooking
 	 		 
 	 		
 
 */

// 1. Think about Object
// OneWayFlightBooking [from, to, departureDate, travelers, travelClass] 

// 2. Create the Class for that Object
// This is definition of object in memory :)
class OneWayFlightBooking{ // whatever is Object -> becomes class name :)
	
	// Attributes: we are writing them in class, but they belong to object
	String from;
	String to;
	String departureDate;
	int travelers;
	int travelClass; // 1 -> economy, 2 business, 3 premium economy
